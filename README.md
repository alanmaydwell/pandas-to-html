# Pandas to HTML

*In Progress*

Trying out exporting multiple Pandas dataframes to an HTML file as a way of 
exporting/recording results.

Uses a mixture of

1. Pandas Styler.render method to auto-generate HTML and directly 
HTML tables 
2. Directly created HTML for other elements of the file (e.g. headings)

Idea is to:

- export a set of dataframes to an HTML file.
- apply dataframe styling before export.
- add headings and nav to the exported file.
